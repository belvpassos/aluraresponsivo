            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone.
                That's the curse of the Time Lords. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family.

                bad always happens. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! I'm the
                Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable!</p>
